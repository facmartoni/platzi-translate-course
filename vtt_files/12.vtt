00:03.209 --> 00:09.419
Hey there. Now we're going to check Present. Perfect continues.

00:09.490 --> 00:14.300
Okay, so we have far different structures going on year.

00:14.300 --> 00:17.379
So we're going to take some information from previous clauses.

00:17.379 --> 00:24.179
We're going to check something new and most importantly, when we have to use present

00:24.190 --> 00:27.899
Perfect continues. So what's present? Perfect. Continue.

00:27.899 --> 00:31.329
So, as you know, from the previous close present, perfect.

00:31.329 --> 00:38.140
We use it to talk about experiences and we don't emphasize if the action is finished or if it was completed

00:38.140 --> 00:47.219
or homing tanks. It happened. Not really. But when we use the continuity, there's when we add the

00:47.219 --> 00:52.350
continues aspect of it, we do emphasize duration.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.570
So we emphasize that inaction started in the past and continues all the way up to

01:00.570 --> 01:07.620
the present. So in terms off structure, since it is present perfect, we have to use the

01:07.620 --> 01:13.849
axillary for the perfect sentences, which is half or house, depending on the subject.

01:14.340 --> 01:21.250
We also have to use the verb in the past partisan bull, you know, like the third

01:21.250 --> 01:27.859
column of the verbs that we have talked about. But since we're including the continues aspect

01:27.859 --> 01:34.959
to it, we're going toe talk about continuity are lasting action we have to use the

01:34.959 --> 01:41.750
adage. Remember the association? Every time that we talk about Perfect, we have house

01:42.319 --> 01:48.750
on past participle, and every time that we talk about continues, it involves some

01:48.750 --> 01:58.129
form of the verb to be on D i n g. So all of these concepts come together to express in

01:58.129 --> 02:01.629
action that started in the past and continues all the way to the present.

02:01.640 --> 02:10.849
So what's it? What that's it look like? Well, I have Bean practicing my reading skills for the last

02:11.240 --> 02:19.840
two weeks. You see, easy to understand, I am asking, or I am transmitting on

02:19.840 --> 02:26.580
information that deals with an action that started in the past and continued for

02:26.860 --> 02:30.979
two weeks in this particular example. So what's the construction?

02:30.990 --> 02:39.360
Let's see how it goes. So because you're gonna see we have again the axillary, which is half for

02:39.370 --> 02:48.379
all the perfect fences. And since we're talking about continues, we also have to include the vert

02:48.379 --> 02:53.270
Toby on and I in Gene divert and where's ever to be here?

02:53.819 --> 03:01.349
It's conjugated in the past parties. Why? Because it's followed, um, by half

03:01.840 --> 03:08.360
That's it. You know, after half we have the vertebrae in passport is people, just as

03:08.360 --> 03:14.250
it would be if it were a normal present. Perfect structure.

03:14.610 --> 03:25.210
So the continuity aspect is being transmitted by half and they were to be in passports and

03:25.210 --> 03:33.639
then I n g So if you notice this structure is even even easier than the previous ones because

03:33.639 --> 03:37.139
the structure is always going to be the same half inverted V.

03:37.150 --> 03:44.129
That means half being. Or if we're talking about she like in the negative example we have here House

03:44.289 --> 03:52.280
Yes, have Bean has bean have bean has been This is the one that we're always going to be using and

03:52.280 --> 03:58.400
then the only modification, the only change that we're going to express is the vert.

03:59.039 --> 04:04.280
But this verb is always going to be 90 so very, very simple.

04:04.430 --> 04:08.900
So let's check more Ah, examples in which we could use this.

04:08.909 --> 04:16.160
For example. You want to talk about an action that has bean happening all of these days all

04:16.160 --> 04:26.250
the way up to the present. For example, I have bean taking English clauses for

04:26.250 --> 04:35.189
two months now, So the action started two months ago and it continued all the way nonstop till

04:35.189 --> 04:42.709
the present. So I emphasized that continuities aspect of it by using the i n g for

04:42.709 --> 04:49.370
this construction. So the present perfect part makes it in the past on the continues foreign makes

04:49.370 --> 04:54.870
it to talk about a continues action. So I have bean practicing.

04:55.060 --> 05:00.009
I have me reading. I have been sleeping a lot Graham on vacation.

05:00.310 --> 05:02.930
So that actually started. The bus continues in the present.

05:03.259 --> 05:09.959
So again, the construction four questions. It's going to be quite similar depending

05:09.970 --> 05:15.439
on the answer that you're looking for. If what we're looking for is that yes or no answer, we use

05:15.970 --> 05:20.930
Ah, the construction first with the exterior. So have you been playing since yesterday?

05:21.319 --> 05:26.449
Yes, I have, like every single day. Yes, I have, or no, I haven't.

05:27.120 --> 05:36.879
But if what we're looking for is a complete I'm certain we use where I was interrogated Pregnant?

05:37.050 --> 05:40.139
Where have you been hiding all this time? No, I'm sorry.

05:40.139 --> 05:49.060
I've bean working a lot lately. I'm being very BC I have been taking care of a lot of problems

05:49.060 --> 05:55.449
that I've had Do emphasize the D action starting the past continues in the present and

05:55.449 --> 06:02.439
for the negative as well. We used the negative particle not and is going to be located again.

06:02.730 --> 06:11.250
Between the axillary on and been bean is always going to be used in present.

06:11.259 --> 06:16.550
Perfect continues because for two continues, I repeat, we have to use the verb to be.

06:17.449 --> 06:24.449
And since this virtue ease after the axillary, we have to use being which is the past participle for

06:24.459 --> 06:28.100
So we look at the example from the negative part we have.

06:28.100 --> 06:35.509
She has not bean feeling well lately. So she started feeling poorly in the past and

06:35.779 --> 06:43.550
that action continues in the present. She's still feeling, but she's not feeling well.

06:43.910 --> 06:50.360
Yes, I have been sleeping as much as I need. I haven't been sleeping as much as I need.

06:51.439 --> 06:59.040
A couple of days ago, I started to sleep less than a shoot and that action still

06:59.040 --> 07:06.740
happening? Maybe this person is BZ o. It has a lot of work show Just to recap, we go when

07:06.740 --> 07:14.040
we see the use of the present perfect combined with a continues form so present perfect.

07:14.050 --> 07:19.910
We have dictionary half on the past participle and with the continues, we have the

07:19.910 --> 07:26.529
verb to be a 90. We combined this together and we have present perfect continues A

07:26.709 --> 07:34.029
structure that includes the national started in the past and continues all the way to the present.

07:34.040 --> 07:40.500
And we emphasize the time. Right? So I have been practicing guitar.

07:41.189 --> 07:48.480
No, several days is weak by now. I have been reading many books lately because

07:48.480 --> 07:52.540
I have a lot of free time. Action started. The past continues in the press.

07:53.139 --> 07:58.370
So these concludes the present perfect constructions.

07:58.379 --> 08:05.019
Both the simple one on the continues one because now we're going to jump for the

08:05.089 --> 08:09.279
perfect part. But of the past. So in the next cause, we're going to check past

08:09.279 --> 08:13.410
perfect and what it works for. How do we use it?
