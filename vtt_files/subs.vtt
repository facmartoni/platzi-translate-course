WEBVTT

01:06.140 --> 01:13.400
Perfect, no. Thanks to you for being here, we are really really honored to have you and, well, let's begin.

01:14.057 --> 01:18.257
The first question I have for you It's very simple: Why computer science?

01:19.942 --> 01:28.400
Ah, Yes. Why computer science? I think the answer to that question is going to be different, depending on who you ask.

01:28.650 --> 01:31.800
I have a very long answer to that question.

01:34.257 --> 01:46.628
It borrows down to for me to needing to know the fundamentals and that's how I thought I could go about accomplishing that.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.628
Um, so that was the short answer. Do you want the long answer?

01:52.457 --> 01:54.942
Yeah, let's do the long answer.

01:55.485 --> 02:03.885
All right. So when I was... when I had the opportunity to go to college

02:04.542 --> 02:10.514
I definitely wanted to go to college. I definitely wanted to get the education, I wanted to get that degree in the my bouts.

02:11.285 --> 02:16.657
I didn't think I could go out and do anything unless I had a degree

02:17.028 --> 02:23.685
And so I got a bachelor's degree, my undergrad,

02:23.914 --> 02:29.657
And I was so fascinated with school. I love studying. Not everybody does. I do.

02:29.942 --> 02:38.200
And there were so many degrees I could choose from. I was, uh, having a hard time, and I was tending to go towards tech

02:38.685 --> 02:43.285
or business and or philosophy or marketing,

02:43.571 --> 02:52.257
but I settled on business administration with, like, a sort of secondary degree in in MIS.

02:52.457 --> 02:59.200
back then measurement of information systems was a thing. We don't talk about it anymore, but

02:59.342 --> 03:06.257
I did a little bit of programming and did a lot of projects in school. I learned about data bases,

03:06.371 --> 03:09.485
so I got to build some stuff through acquiring that degree.

03:09.942 --> 03:17.400
Now, when I left, I went to work more on the business side of things that when the Internet was booming,

03:17.685 --> 03:21.314
I went to work as an Internet marketing manager.

03:21.457 --> 03:28.742
So I worked a couple of years doing that, and I felt that I wasn't building anything. I was analyzing a lot of spreadsheets,

03:28.971 --> 03:34.114
I was like doing busy work, but I missed building things.

03:34.828 --> 03:42.714
So I said, Well, I know a little bit of tech and tech was so hot, it was back in... what is it? 2008

03:43.457 --> 03:50.142
before 2008, actually. So I said, well, I'm definitely going to be able to get a job.

03:50.371 --> 03:56.542
So I went for it and then the market, we had the tech crash

03:57.228 --> 04:01.257
and nobody was hiring anymore and there were definitely hiring people

04:01.714 --> 04:06.942
the few companies that were hiring, definitely not hiring people without a degree

04:07.114 --> 04:16.742
or who could show that they had a lot of work experience or knowledge in programming which I didn't.

04:17.228 --> 04:26.114
So I decided to go and get a Masters degree in computer science because I was very sure I have no choice. This is what I want to do

04:26.200 --> 04:33.142
I wasn't necessarily wanting to get another degree. I just wanted that computer science degree.

04:33.342 --> 04:40.942
because I didn't feel that anytime soon I would be able to walk through a door and landing a job giving the market situation.

04:41.685 --> 04:47.828
And, um, that's how I got, that's how I ended up with a computer science degree.

04:48.914 --> 04:55.228
Amazing. You actually fought against a very rough situation in that time.

04:55.380 --> 05:02.628
Now it seems quite more easy to Start working in tech, in development, in computer science related stuff.

05:02.828 --> 05:06.171
Actually, many big companies are hiring without a degree, right?

05:06.371 --> 05:09.457
And now you can learn it in many, many ways.

05:10.200 --> 05:16.371
What do you think about that? Like, what's your point of view on how the market has changed

05:16.571 --> 05:19.085
And where are we right now?

05:19.742 --> 05:27.171
The market, everything has changed. The market has changed a lot. A lot is more accessible.

05:27.600 --> 05:34.114
There's so many so many courses online, so many very high quality courses online.

05:34.514 --> 05:38.942
And even the editors The editors that I use today

05:39.085 --> 05:45.428
I kept thinking: Wow if I had an editor like this that allow me so much inside to the code and

05:46.085 --> 05:55.971
made it so easy to write text at the beginning, I would have, you know, getting to be an expert soon, Like...

05:56.142 --> 06:00.942
an expert in whatever I was doing sooner than then, however long it took

06:01.129 --> 06:05.449
because it's so much easy to grasp what it is that you're doing.

06:06.914 --> 06:13.200
So, yeah, everything changed with the Internet. There are so many forums, you have access to people, you can ask questions.

06:15.685 --> 06:21.250
But I still think that there is value in getting a degree, though, even with all of the courses out there.

06:21.942 --> 06:26.560
And I have worked with people who have degrees and with people who don't have degrees,

06:26.560 --> 06:31.949
and I think there is a difference in how they approach things.

06:33.839 --> 06:38.220
Yeah, I actually totally agree with that and here in

06:38.220 --> 06:44.300
Platzi we're working this. This should be off the record or, I don't know, because it's a big spoiler

06:44.310 --> 06:50.699
we're working on something called the School of Computer Science because we actually want

06:50.879 --> 06:59.879
to let our students get their ability of highly abstract thinking to understand, like all

06:59.879 --> 07:05.449
of the techniques and everything that they really need to do, so they can face many

07:05.449 --> 07:10.689
challenges and they will not need a specific tutorial, a specific guide

07:10.689 --> 07:17.089
but they will be able to think about the trouble and find a solution with the base of knowledge that

07:17.089 --> 07:20.769
they already have. So we actually totally agree with that

07:20.769 --> 07:27.000
and I love it how you bring that to the table. I actually have another question, and I want to know

07:27.009 --> 07:32.490
because you're a very big open source software contributor and you've contribute to

07:32.490 --> 07:37.860
amazing stuff like the go programming language. Of course, like you, you contribute to open source

07:37.870 --> 07:44.310
software as a day job, right? And that's very interesting because, like usually everybody

07:44.319 --> 07:49.730
thinks that open source software doesn't give you money like it's something you do because you want

07:49.730 --> 07:55.850
to learn or because you want to do some good to the people out there and help grow any products.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.420
But you're working on that. How is that process?

07:58.420 --> 08:03.629
How did you do it? How did you contribute to a programming language like go? and what

08:03.629 --> 08:10.680
can you tell us about it? Yeah, that's another question that it is going to have a million different

08:10.769 --> 08:15.639
answers. Usually before I speak how I got into it.

08:15.800 --> 08:23.930
Just if people wanted to get an insight, usually people do open source software.

08:24.029 --> 08:31.269
by way of they have a need themselves they develop a little tool and they think, well, if I just

08:31.800 --> 08:39.710
I don't do this to our extract this part of my code and put it up on a source control system, maybe

08:39.710 --> 08:45.919
GitHub and make that available for people because the same way I needed it.

08:45.929 --> 08:50.610
I know a lot of people going to need it, too. And that's how people get started with being a

08:50.610 --> 08:54.039
maintainer. But then you being a maintainer of your own project.

08:54.039 --> 08:59.009
And then other people can join and help you, and then you provoke them to maintain it, too.

08:59.009 --> 09:05.940
And that could potentially grow, you could develop a reputation and getting to other projects, too

09:05.940 --> 09:11.200
So that's one way another way is to make contributions to project.

09:11.480 --> 09:17.600
And one thing that I love about open source is that you make a tiny contribution, and that is so valuable

09:17.600 --> 09:28.179
that, you know, people think, Wow, people are always admire contributors to open source

09:28.429 --> 09:34.679
because any contribution is valuable. I sure have made contributions.

09:34.679 --> 09:37.860
And, I wouldn't necessarily write home about someone.

09:38.840 --> 09:46.389
but you know, because if you imagine, in terms of size or complexity, yeah, they didn't make

09:46.389 --> 09:52.019
a dent in the project necessary. But any small contribution is super valuable in

09:52.019 --> 09:56.789
just the process of making that contribution, learning how to project works.

09:57.019 --> 10:01.480
Sometimes you have to change one little code, one tiny thing

10:01.480 --> 10:05.070
That is not difficult. But you do have to build a code.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.259
You do have maybe to bring the test for the cold.

10:07.269 --> 10:11.029
You have to install things around like peripherals that need to interact.

10:11.029 --> 10:14.610
So you know that you didn't break anything.

10:14.620 --> 10:21.460
and that's ah valuable lesson for you to learn, and yeah.

10:21.460 --> 10:26.159
Amazing, I actually love it like we talked about how important it is to learn computer science.

10:26.159 --> 10:31.330
Like the roots we talk about contributing to open source software.

10:31.340 --> 10:37.759
Now, I want to talk something a little bit more spicy because, like in our community, we have a lot

10:37.759 --> 10:43.850
of choices and a lot of people who, like cheer for a language like JavaScript it's better, no

10:43.850 --> 10:49.830
the better is C, now the better is that. Do you have a favorite programming language?

10:50.440 --> 11:00.240
I do. Nice. Yes, I work with Go. I've been working with Go since I started letting going back

11:00.240 --> 11:09.850
in 2015. In 2016 I got my first job, my first paying job writing code, full time, and I have not looked

11:09.860 --> 11:15.889
back. I have to say I haven't looked into Rust. Um, so I don't a lot of people praise

11:15.889 --> 11:20.879
Rust. They love it. There are a lot of similarities with Go in terms of being, ah, lingers.

11:20.919 --> 11:27.860
That's very, a language that is very, has a good fit for for writing through the systems.

11:28.340 --> 11:37.690
Now the reason why I like Go, is because I hate to say this because nothing computer science or programming

11:37.700 --> 11:42.080
it's simple but its simple is not. I'm not saying it's easy.

11:42.090 --> 11:46.639
It requires efforts for you to learn. But the syntax has.

11:46.639 --> 11:54.210
I think 25 keywords, the API. They're very good about not changing the API, not adding

11:54.210 --> 11:57.669
a lot of to the language unless they absolutely have to.

11:58.289 --> 12:04.389
If you contrast that with Ruby, for example, just like to have a base for comparison.

12:04.940 --> 12:13.850
When I came into Ruby, I knew C, I knew Java, I knew PHP, C# things like that.

12:14.240 --> 12:21.649
So when I came into Ruby, it was completely new to me that all the aspects of programming

12:21.649 --> 12:27.460
with a dynamic language. I thought was fascinating in absolute love

12:27.460 --> 12:33.299
There was completely different, and also there was a whole amazing community around it.

12:33.740 --> 12:40.600
but the whole time that I was using Ruby, I struggled with it because every time I wanted to

12:40.610 --> 12:49.000
write a stupid function. I had to go on the Internet, look up like what was the best way to write

12:49.000 --> 12:54.080
that function? like what was the best call? or like that would be like 10, 15 calls

12:54.080 --> 12:57.289
that I could use, each one will have a trade off.

12:57.500 --> 13:02.850
And before I submitted my code to a code review where people were going to talk about that, I'm I could

13:02.850 --> 13:09.909
last me for into that discussion by finding what if I didn't already know, like, finally what people

13:09.909 --> 13:15.750
think is best? It was a whole all the time I was doing that and it was pretty pathetic.

13:16.710 --> 13:19.799
Rubiy is a great language, the community is to great

13:19.980 --> 13:27.919
I just had I couldn't keep it in my head and I just felt that it was so much work,

13:27.929 --> 13:33.190
that was busywork, basically, because there were so many options.

13:34.039 --> 13:41.769
Now when I went, when I found out about Go first of all, the speed, because

13:41.769 --> 13:48.340
at that time I was not just writing Ruby I was using Ruby on Rails and then I had apps that had speed

13:48.340 --> 13:55.789
issues, like when testing and I was looking at some comparisons and Go just was

13:55.789 --> 14:02.320
blowing my mind in that apartment. That wasn't what holds me in, but why I stayed was because I was

14:02.320 --> 14:08.870
just finding Go so minimalist and simple. I write things I I don't have to ever

14:08.870 --> 14:12.700
look up on eternal live like really rare that I have to all.

14:12.700 --> 14:18.809
how do I iterated through an array? Because there is only one way

14:18.820 --> 14:23.289
Usually, so you know what I mean. So that's why Go is reading my favorite.

14:23.519 --> 14:27.639
Like I said, I don't know Rust. I don't know absolutely all the languages.

14:27.639 --> 14:35.549
But that's why I like Go so much. Amazing, I actually love Go the first time I use it because

14:35.940 --> 14:43.549
I came from C programming language and I did a lot of code in C programming language, and

14:43.559 --> 14:48.870
when I started to learning Go for the first time. It was like, Oh, it doesn't have classes? It only has

14:49.029 --> 14:55.679
structs? so, like, this is amazing. This is like like C, right? and actually, many people who

14:55.690 --> 15:01.730
didn't start with the old language, like C is, like, get a little bit confused. I actually love

15:01.740 --> 15:07.019
that, and I totally agree with you about that simplicity that Go has on it, and

15:07.029 --> 15:11.509
and it helps a little bit in you can have one way of doing things and

15:11.509 --> 15:15.649
you are more confident that you are doing it the right way right?, because

15:15.659 --> 15:18.750
when the programming languages do have more choices,

15:18.750 --> 15:22.360
more options, well, the things get a little bit more complicated.

15:22.370 --> 15:29.149
I totally agree, lovely, so what was your first programming language?

15:30.240 --> 15:39.309
First one, Um, I'm going to say I don't remember because I went to school and I had

15:39.309 --> 15:43.139
all this classes and I know I took like classes that required one

15:43.139 --> 15:47.450
like they will give two options. So I knew it, I took C

15:47.799 --> 15:54.399
I took Java, I took classes that where you It's those two languages, for sure.

15:54.409 --> 16:00.720
I think only those two actually. The first language that I gave a lot of thought to

16:00.730 --> 16:08.230
was Java for I wanted to become an expert, play experts, to the extent possible.

16:08.230 --> 16:12.500
So I started for the certification and I'm not saying certification

16:12.500 --> 16:17.840
Everybody should have it, for me was like it was all about having a syllabus that I could follow in

16:17.840 --> 16:22.899
check boxes like OK, I know this. I know this, I know this and don't know when those things just

16:22.899 --> 16:25.549
is going to make me understand the language better.

16:25.899 --> 16:31.679
So I got the Java entry level one the programmer certification.

16:31.960 --> 16:39.519
So I felt very confident wit Java, so, yeah, I'll say that. I've noticed in something very important

16:39.519 --> 16:43.399
and something that we actually say a lot to our students.

16:43.399 --> 16:49.049
And it is that you don't only have one programming language and you try to do it

16:49.360 --> 16:55.039
everything with that programming language, I see like you learned a lot of programming languages

16:55.200 --> 16:59.210
and we actually want to know, What do you think about it?

16:59.210 --> 17:04.690
Because some programmers here in LATAM or some students say, like, this is the best programming

17:04.690 --> 17:09.509
language, and I want to do everything with this, like from video games to

17:09.509 --> 17:14.029
backend services, to realtime applications, to embedded systems.

17:14.269 --> 17:18.349
It's kind of crazy, right? Like, what do you think about that?

17:19.740 --> 17:27.970
I think that is definitely an advantage in learning more branches now like

17:29.200 --> 17:33.680
let's talk about this quick, is there many questions you within this question that are the question

17:33.680 --> 17:39.490
So one question is, should you know more than one programming language? at least in my head

17:39.630 --> 17:45.430
that's the one question here. Absolutely. Yes, you should make a point in learning.

17:45.480 --> 17:52.539
You should know at least two, and in this very I know you're company is obviously

17:52.539 --> 17:59.049
very multilingual. I'm here doing this interview in English and you probably going to be translating

17:59.049 --> 18:07.069
And your audience is mostly from Latin America. If you speak two languages, you know you have an advantage

18:07.069 --> 18:11.009
And if you're going to learn a third is going to be a lot easier, if you're going through this process

18:11.079 --> 18:15.700
you know it's true. And you're in the very least you probably have heard that is true.

18:15.950 --> 18:21.599
It is a very same with programming languages. You learn one and you struggle because you've never programmed

18:21.609 --> 18:26.579
before. And then you learn the second one and it's contrasting things and all of a sudden you

18:26.579 --> 18:29.690
start is not it is no longer about the programming language

18:29.690 --> 18:39.009
is about computer systems, like the mechanic is the mechanics that those languages that syntax

18:39.019 --> 18:46.509
is driving. You start to understand once you start to manipulate it with different languages, you

18:46.509 --> 18:49.109
just like things to start coming together in your head.

18:49.740 --> 18:56.130
Uh, nothing wrong witch just knowing one. I'm just saying that if you learn more, you going

18:56.130 --> 19:01.950
to out automatically gain the benefit without making a lot of effort of understanding computer systems.

19:01.950 --> 19:08.130
Now, should you use one language, whether you know multiple languages which are I'm not sure.

19:08.130 --> 19:11.990
Should you use one language for everything? Absolutely not.

19:12.230 --> 19:15.579
No, cn you like, if you're doing that as a hobby?

19:15.579 --> 19:25.240
Sure. But is not going to be efficient. So you have to find out if you want to let you feel running

19:25.240 --> 19:32.170
a team you have to to analyze what are the options here that would make that system that you're writing

19:32.170 --> 19:39.960
whatever it is, be more productive like that, you have to get productivity out of your team.

19:40.170 --> 19:43.720
Because if you're writing with the language, that doesn't allow you to do a bunch of things and you

19:43.720 --> 19:49.460
have to like, be hacking things, you're going to shoot your product, your team productivity.

19:49.460 --> 19:54.170
So language matters. I'm really loving everything you're telling us.

19:54.180 --> 19:58.529
I'm really happy to have you here, thank you and I have one last question.

19:58.539 --> 20:02.210
Here at Platzi we have a lot of students and we love them all.

20:02.279 --> 20:10.369
But I would love for you to tell a little message to all of or possible students or potential students

20:10.369 --> 20:16.880
that are mainly female students that don't believe that they can entered this field of computer science

20:16.940 --> 20:24.640
and triumph here. Yeah, well, join the club because I almost feel like that every day, even

20:24.640 --> 20:27.690
though I'm already have been doing this for a long time.

20:27.690 --> 20:30.779
That is always something that I think Oh, it is this.

20:30.779 --> 20:35.309
I didn't get the memo on how to do this, but I think it really helps.

20:36.089 --> 20:42.809
I think the issue is one big issue is that when you do things in isolation, you don't know there are

20:42.809 --> 20:49.670
other people were struggling to and I think the the issue with gender, this gender division is that

20:51.000 --> 20:54.980
well, computer science and programming are top male-dominated.

20:55.299 --> 21:02.750
So it's very easy for guys to find guys and do the guy thing, right? in women might not want to or might not be

21:02.750 --> 21:09.920
welcoming, because the thing is, if the all of these two group, these two groups

21:09.920 --> 21:16.250
male, female, were, interacting all the time, you would see a lot of guys were naturally

21:16.250 --> 21:19.529
confident and you just don't know how they know everything their turns.

21:19.529 --> 21:26.309
I've got people like that, women too, and that's another thing that you could get exposed to women

21:26.309 --> 21:33.069
who also are very naturally talented. But there are a lot of people who also struggle, but you don't

21:33.069 --> 21:38.930
see because you don't interacting with them, and I have been lucky, lucky the way that I've been

21:39.089 --> 21:46.150
I stuck to it and because I like it, and I've seen a lot of all kinds of people struggle, same

21:46.150 --> 21:50.380
way I struggled. So by struggling, it's is a thing.

21:50.380 --> 21:55.170
and that's something that I say to people who do want to learn computer science or

21:55.170 --> 22:03.160
learn programming is that definitely try it out. But if you try out and you like it, stick to it

22:04.039 --> 22:09.170
because it really requires persistence

22:09.180 --> 22:13.390
It takes a lot of concentration.

22:13.619 --> 22:20.029
And if you don't like it, you fight. You keep fighting and you're not going to get deep, and you

22:20.029 --> 22:23.660
need to get deep to understand the concepts and the fundamentals.

22:24.019 --> 22:31.710
and just talking about computer science, it really helps have following a curriculum,

22:31.710 --> 22:39.569
and so you know, the things that you have that you can learn to give you to use.

22:39.569 --> 22:46.970
It was not the incident. It is not the first day I was going to give it.

22:46.970 --> 22:49.539
I went into totally different directions. No, but

22:49.539 --> 22:52.960
I liked it. This is of the record, by the way for the energy.

22:53.970 --> 22:58.470
Do you want to add something like, Can I do a follow up question? or

22:58.480 --> 23:02.160
you're fine with that. No, no, If you want to follow up, it's fine with me.

23:02.569 --> 23:07.410
Perfect, I loved what you say. It's very important.

23:07.420 --> 23:14.140
It's a very important message. And actually, when you as a student, when you're starting, you see

23:14.140 --> 23:18.829
these people right now who are on the top of it, and they seem to know it all and

23:18.829 --> 23:25.859
they are your teachers, right? And they like, they are people that does everything, code in many languages

23:25.859 --> 23:32.160
for example, Carlisia. But it's important to take notice of that like they didn't started

23:32.309 --> 23:39.509
with all of the knowledge. So, yeah, with that, I will just ask if is there anything else you want

23:39.519 --> 23:46.450
to say to our viewers Carlisia? Well, you make me reminds,

23:46.490 --> 23:52.740
remember something, a lot of times when you look, look up to someone,

23:52.740 --> 23:57.369
I don't even consider myself an expert. I'm an expert in the sense that I've been doing programming

23:57.369 --> 24:04.420
for a long time. So but everything I do is new, so I feel like, Oh, my gosh, I'm struggling

24:04.420 --> 24:07.160
I'm always struggling because everything is new. You know how it is.

24:07.759 --> 24:12.950
But I do have I have acquired some some good feelings about things and that helps a lot.

24:14.039 --> 24:19.670
Now, when you look up as someone who is an expert has been doing whatever for a long time and

24:19.680 --> 24:25.519
if they speak in a way that maybe you don't understand and if you ask them a question, they might give

24:25.519 --> 24:31.460
you an answer that makes no sense at all. And then you you might turn to yourself and think, Wow,

24:31.470 --> 24:37.920
I answer. I asked the question that I need an answer for this person who's an expert answered

24:37.930 --> 24:42.559
and I cannot make sense like I understand the words, but I don't know what they're saying.

24:42.619 --> 24:47.940
It happens to me all the time, by the way, therefore, it's me, right?

24:47.940 --> 24:53.650
because the expert give me an answer I should know. But this is what happens at

24:53.660 --> 24:56.200
when people have been doing something for a long time.

24:56.430 --> 25:02.309
So called experts and that is for every few they think, they think about these in a different way.

25:02.460 --> 25:08.980
They talk about things in a different level and a lot of times when I ask people, people who

25:08.980 --> 25:14.240
are experts, they tell me how to do things, But they're not necessarily explaining to me what I'm

25:14.250 --> 25:19.869
asking, which is what even is this? don't tell me how to use it, because I can

25:19.869 --> 25:25.900
memorize it, I can write it down, but what I want to know is what is this? because I'm not

25:25.900 --> 25:33.920
even there yet. It's very helpful to talk with beginners or newcomers in try to learn

25:33.920 --> 25:38.650
things from each other, like you agree to have the same whenever you learning something.

25:38.650 --> 25:44.230
Even if you're in the field for a long time, but you're dropping into another language or a new

25:44.230 --> 25:51.609
system, seek out beginners to to learn from and collaborate with.

25:51.619 --> 25:56.660
Those are going to be very good experiences in my opinion.

25:57.839 --> 26:00.349
Oh, that's amazing. Thank you very much.

26:00.740 --> 26:07.309
I will only add

26:40.000 --> 26:42.789
Well, Carlisia, I really loved this interview.

26:42.799 --> 26:47.200
I loved having you here. I'm sure our students will want a course by you.

26:47.329 --> 26:54.690
You will be an amazing go teacher. I'm just so happy to have you here,

26:54.690 --> 27:00.640
really, and I wanted to say thank you. In the name of Platzi and all of our community, for sharing

27:00.640 --> 27:06.420
this time with with us. I know you're a very busy person and well, I really, really thank you

27:06.420 --> 27:10.410
I don't know if you wanna share your social networks where they can follow you.

27:10.529 --> 27:15.210
You have an amazing podcast about cloud computing and

27:15.440 --> 27:20.109
So maybe you can talk a little bit about that. Yeah, it was so lovely to be here

27:20.109 --> 27:22.789
and do this. It sounds like you have a wonderful community.

27:23.440 --> 27:28.730
the best way to interact with me is on Twitter I pop in there all the time.

27:28.740 --> 27:33.759
I talked to people they are out in the open, and I think it's fun in the highly recommend

27:33.769 --> 27:39.710
for talk people who are not in Twitter to hop in there and start making connections because a lot

27:39.720 --> 27:42.849
happens there, people get jobs from it, is amazing.

27:43.210 --> 27:47.000
So it's my first name. My first name is my handle

27:47.000 --> 27:54.119
and like Ricardo said, I am a host of a podcast that talks about cloud native concepts.

27:54.599 --> 28:00.740
It was something I started because when I joined in this world, I was not familiar with

28:00.740 --> 28:03.089
the concepts and I was asking around What is this?

28:03.089 --> 28:10.569
What is this? And I finally figure out Hey, I want to be the change

28:10.630 --> 28:14.119
I want to be the force in the world that I want. You know what I mean?

28:15.009 --> 28:22.880
As figure. Wow. I put together a podcast to help people who are aware was a year ago.

28:23.299 --> 28:26.549
and because also I didn't see that there was anything like that.

28:26.549 --> 28:31.569
So if you want to learn about called native Concepts, hop onto the podlets.io

28:31.569 --> 28:38.039
Yeah, thank you very much. We will, of course, put the link to your podcasts and to your twitter

28:38.039 --> 28:41.650
account here on the chat so our students can follow you.

28:41.819 --> 28:44.890
And Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you very much.

28:44.900 --> 28:49.150
I'm now for our students. I want to say you something in Spanish.
