00:03.240 --> 00:08.279
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to communicate with our customer accurately

00:08.509 --> 00:13.869
The goals for this lesson are going to be planning considering priorities and also understanding the

00:13.869 --> 00:20.579
concept off milestones. So let's talk about how to plan considering priorities

00:20.670 --> 00:26.859
Remember that we previously played planning poker with our customer, and the total time of

00:26.859 --> 00:33.759
the estimates that it was going to take us to produce all the user stories was going to be 300 days

00:33.920 --> 00:41.820
300 days is a very long time in work days. Remember that every year has 200 work days about

00:41.829 --> 00:50.520
200 and 220 work days. So if you consider that 300 days would be over a year for a project. Now

00:50.530 --> 00:56.649
our customer doesn't always have a year to wait for the completion of a project.

00:56.820 --> 01:00.070
In this case, you go and you talk to your customer.

01:00.070 --> 01:04.849
In the example we have that we talked to the customer and we tell the customer, Hey, we estimated

01:04.849 --> 01:10.140
300 days, but the customer says, hey, listen, I don't think I have 300 days.

01:10.239 --> 01:17.030
I was actually thinking about having the project down in 90 days, so 300 days, 90 days?

01:17.209 --> 01:21.189
The difference is abysmal. It is a very big difference.

01:21.239 --> 01:29.189
So what do you do in this situation? And do you start cutting down on the number of user stories or

01:29.189 --> 01:33.310
that you start hiring other software developers to help you with the process?

01:33.310 --> 01:39.780
What do you do when you have a very different estimate from what your customer is expecting?

01:39.969 --> 01:45.959
Imagine that you told your customer that you have that your estimate is 300 days and the customer wants

01:45.959 --> 01:50.620
you to the everything in 90 days. Well, in that case, you're going to have to

01:50.629 --> 01:57.140
cut ah down on the number of user stories and you're gonna have to go back and prioritize those

01:57.140 --> 02:03.650
stories with your client. It is very important that you make your client responsible for selecting

02:03.650 --> 02:07.590
the most relevant user stories. It is your customers decision.

02:07.739 --> 02:11.900
This is a very good way to ensure that your customer will be happy with the end

02:11.900 --> 02:17.139
product because you are involving her in the decision making process.

02:17.590 --> 02:23.520
The way to do this is that you should have a meeting with your client and you lay out all the user stories

02:23.520 --> 02:30.240
on the table and you ask her about the order of your priorities, the order of the user stories that

02:30.240 --> 02:36.800
you are going to end up coding later on. Now your customer has now made a decision.

02:36.800 --> 02:41.750
Perhaps with a little help from you, you're gonna Something important is that you tell your customer

02:41.750 --> 02:48.599
which user stories are the most important. And then once you have a good number of user stories or

02:48.599 --> 02:55.870
you have selected the user stories that you will work on, then you continue and you take those use

02:55.870 --> 03:01.750
their stories because those user stories will be apart off your milestone 1.0.

03:02.840 --> 03:08.680
Now, I have just mentioned a milestone, and this is another concept that we're going to learn.

03:08.889 --> 03:15.620
The concept off a milestone is a major release. This is the time when you have ah

03:15.620 --> 03:22.500
lot of user stories. You have already gone through borderless two or three different iterations, and

03:22.500 --> 03:27.750
what do you need to do is you have to put all of those together and release your

03:27.750 --> 03:33.379
software. This is very important. It is a very important part of the process, and it is different

03:33.379 --> 03:41.240
from iterations. Iterations are smaller cycles, these are more or less one month long cycles that

03:41.240 --> 03:46.360
you will put together in order to create a milestone.

03:46.419 --> 03:53.099
Now, when you're delivering your software, you definitely expect to get paid for that software.

03:53.150 --> 03:56.759
So iterations and a milestone are very different.

03:56.770 --> 04:02.849
Also because iteration normally and with your customers feedback.

04:03.340 --> 04:08.360
so putting together all the feedback that you are getting from your customer after

04:08.360 --> 04:14.360
doing those iterations, you are going to form a milestone, and that's when you're going to deliver

04:14.370 --> 04:23.040
software to your customer. A milestone is all about delivering software with baseline functionality

04:23.230 --> 04:30.550
Something that is very important is that you don't, you try to avoid including any sort of fantasy functions

04:30.800 --> 04:37.209
Instead, you should focus on delivering software that will cover just the baseline functionality.

04:37.470 --> 04:40.860
Now is not the time to include any fancy functions.

04:40.860 --> 04:45.860
Now is the time to focus on delivering baseline functionality.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.410
This is the end of this lesson, and I will see you in the next class where we're going to review the concepts we have covered so far.
