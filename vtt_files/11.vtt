00:03.220 --> 00:11.380
welcome back. So remember the topic that we discussed in previous clauses, um, regular irregular

00:11.380 --> 00:18.129
birds and how these different verbs interact with different tenses this past or future Serra

00:18.129 --> 00:26.149
tear up. But for these particular cause, we're going to see the use off the past participle, right

00:26.160 --> 00:30.980
Which is, if you look at a vert on a list, you will always find there are like three

00:30.980 --> 00:38.049
columns. First column expresses the present second column spreads the past and the third, the past

00:38.299 --> 00:44.390
participle. And that's the one that we're going to use for these construction present

00:44.390 --> 00:49.299
Perfect. Now what is that present perfect? Well, prison perfect.

00:49.409 --> 00:56.100
He's on a structure that we use to emphasize in action that started in the past and

00:56.100 --> 01:00.539
that we don't mention if the action is finished. We don't mention it.

01:00.539 --> 01:04.700
The action lasted. We don't even know if the action continues in the present.

01:04.799 --> 01:10.870
Most likely it does. But that's the beauty of present perfect it hasn't expressed.

01:11.750 --> 01:15.200
We give detailed information about the action, right?

01:15.209 --> 01:21.019
So first they'll let the name fool you because it's not present per se.

01:21.239 --> 01:28.629
Is Buster what we're talking about, you know, and in action that is not complete

01:28.640 --> 01:34.840
or at least we don't emphasize that is complete. Now, what are the most common uses

01:34.840 --> 01:40.569
of these structure? Well, we can use them to talk about experiences, or we can use them to talk about

01:40.569 --> 01:46.409
changes. Or we can use them about for situations that started in the past.

01:46.849 --> 01:55.280
And maybe they continue in present. Right? So we'll see how these structure is used to talk about

01:55.290 --> 01:59.909
Maybe you can use it to talk about different experiences that you've had in your life.

01:59.920 --> 02:05.950
No. Have you ever visited United States? Yes, of course I have.

02:06.159 --> 02:12.050
Perfect on experience. Generally emphasize or you don't mention when these action

02:12.050 --> 02:20.590
happened. But you just mentioned the event. Just I have when I don't know is not important.

02:21.039 --> 02:24.539
Did it take a lot of time to complete the action?

02:24.539 --> 02:29.199
We don't know, because present perfect is not very specific.

02:29.199 --> 02:35.240
If you want to emphasize a specific action in the past that was completed, then we use simple past

02:35.250 --> 02:40.460
I visited the United States last year and I was there for two weeks.

02:40.650 --> 02:44.439
Right? But this is not the case because we're talking about experiences.

02:44.629 --> 02:48.789
I have visited many countries. Okay, which ones?

02:49.039 --> 02:55.629
I don't know. Not important. How long ago did you did you go to This place is again

02:55.639 --> 03:01.080
It's not important just mentioning the situation or the action in the past.

03:01.479 --> 03:06.490
So let's check the structure a little bit more in death.

03:06.979 --> 03:14.629
So as you can see here in the different questions and negatives were using anoxia

03:14.830 --> 03:22.039
And these actuary is half. So you see how the pattern repeats itself over and over as

03:22.039 --> 03:24.550
we go through the different tenses of English house.

03:25.060 --> 03:28.340
They were talking about the present we used Do a search, Hillary.

03:28.340 --> 03:33.430
We talk about Paz. We use DEET for these particular structure.

03:33.689 --> 03:39.750
We use half and half easier chillier, right? And it follows the same dynamics.

03:39.750 --> 03:47.090
If we're talking about you we day I I use half. But we're talking about he or she you

03:47.090 --> 03:54.439
use house. So it follows a similar behaviour of the one off Duke and us.

03:54.860 --> 04:02.569
Now you will see that after half the verb Easy nam different foreign.

04:03.300 --> 04:08.400
This is the past participles. We would check the first example in the question Have

04:08.400 --> 04:17.050
you wien to the new restaurant yet? I'm using the form in past participle off the vert movie

04:17.639 --> 04:25.100
And the purpose of this is to ask you if these experience has happened in your life, right?

04:25.259 --> 04:32.000
The answer can be yes or no. We don't mention when the action happened with a mention of the action

04:32.000 --> 04:35.560
is finished. We don't mention anything off that nature.

04:35.730 --> 04:40.800
I'm just interested in seeing the action happened or not.

04:41.069 --> 04:44.709
Yes, so for that could be the yes or no question.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.350
Have you been to the new restaurant yet? Josie, have?

04:47.540 --> 04:52.860
No, I haven't. Yes. And if I want to ask more complex question.

04:53.189 --> 05:02.899
What have you done lately? Okay. In this case, I'm looking for a more complex answer

05:02.930 --> 05:14.579
So okay, lately I have practiced Ah, soccer. I have watched many Siris on the Internet.

05:14.839 --> 05:20.579
I have read many books, experiences, actions that have happened.

05:21.040 --> 05:28.149
But if you analyze each of these sentences, I have watched many Siri's online.

05:28.529 --> 05:36.540
When I don't know, this is not important. I have read different books lately when

05:36.540 --> 05:43.019
Specifically yesterday. Two weeks ago. Again. That is not important when we use present

05:43.019 --> 05:50.930
Perfect. Because the focus off these construction is just to know if financial it happened or

05:50.930 --> 05:56.180
not in the past. Yes, and we don't emphasize if it's finished or not.

05:56.910 --> 06:03.990
And in case you want to use the negative construction again, we use the good old negative

06:03.990 --> 06:11.100
particle. Not, and it's going to be located between the axillary on the verb in past participle,

06:11.110 --> 06:15.550
just like the first example, she has not finished the test.

06:16.029 --> 06:22.509
She has houses the axillary for present perfect congregated for she.

06:22.939 --> 06:30.300
That's why we have Haas than Negative Particle and then finished in this case, finish is

06:30.300 --> 06:34.250
a regular burger. So finished, finished finished.

06:34.620 --> 06:38.670
That's the one that we use. She has not finished the test in this case.

06:39.250 --> 06:44.629
The action is not complete, and we don't emphasize any time in particular because that's

06:44.629 --> 06:49.149
not important, you know, is not relevant for these particular example.

06:49.879 --> 06:54.310
The other one. I haven't been here for a long time again.

06:54.750 --> 07:02.000
This particular we express like change or lack of change because the action maybe

07:02.000 --> 07:09.579
happened at some point in the past. On it hasn't evolved or it hasn't changed up

07:09.579 --> 07:15.980
onto this moment. But again, I don't emphasize when was the last time that I was here or

07:15.980 --> 07:23.629
Holland direction to again? Remember, present Perfect doesn't emphasize duration

07:23.639 --> 07:30.050
doesn't emphasize if the action is complete. No, for that we use the past simple here

07:30.220 --> 07:35.220
We just mentioned if in action happened, took place in the past.

07:35.230 --> 07:38.250
That's why it's so perfect when we talk about experienced.

07:38.639 --> 07:46.730
I have tried typical food from different places. I have visited many interesting

07:46.730 --> 07:55.310
cities in my country. I have watched these movies several times when we don't mention it and

07:55.310 --> 08:02.759
thats why Present Perfect is so commonly used for these particular constructions show

08:02.959 --> 08:07.819
experiences and changes, probably situations that's still happening.

08:07.819 --> 08:12.199
The present. No, I have worked here for many months.

08:12.490 --> 08:18.189
I should start in the past. You don't emphasize the specific moment, but maybe

08:18.199 --> 08:21.600
the actually is not finished, so it's still happening in the present.

08:22.139 --> 08:28.740
So just to recap use of present perfect, they use off the absolutely half with

08:29.040 --> 08:36.100
the past participle off the verbs. Keep in mind that this plus past participle can be regular or irregular

08:36.779 --> 08:42.669
going back to the previous class but past participle nonetheless.

08:42.990 --> 08:48.519
So for the next class we're going to see a similar construction.

08:48.809 --> 08:55.039
But in the next construction, we emphasize duration that's called present, Perfect continues, but
