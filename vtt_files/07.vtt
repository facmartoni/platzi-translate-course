Welcome back, in this lesson we're going to talk about understanding your customer and their requirements.

00:10.339 --> 00:16.600
The concepts that we're going to study in this lesson are the backlog and milestone 1.0.

00:16.789 --> 00:21.160
So the first concept we have for this lesson is the backlog.

00:21.170 --> 00:28.280
What is the backlog? Well, the backlog is nothing more than a big board in your office that you're

00:28.280 --> 00:33.219
going to set up to keep track of your development process.

00:33.289 --> 00:39.770
You are going to need a lot of post-it notes, a lot of sticky notes with different colors, which

00:39.770 --> 00:45.950
you are later going to start posting on the board to basically just keep track

00:46.049 --> 00:51.770
of what's happening throughout your progress. Now, the backlog has different names.

00:51.770 --> 00:57.159
Some people call it the big board on the wall. Some people call it the dashboard.

00:57.159 --> 01:02.399
Some people call it the backlog. So these are different names that the backlog is going to have.

01:02.530 --> 01:12.030
So now, we use this backlog to keep tabs on what work is in the pipeline, what

01:12.030 --> 01:19.989
work is in progress and what work is done. It is a very good visual reminder of what's happening in

01:19.989 --> 01:25.349
your software development process. That is the backlog. Now,

01:25.640 --> 01:30.260
the next concept that we're going to study in this lesson is the milestone

01:30.260 --> 01:35.989
1.0. We earlier talked about the milestone and what it was, but it

01:35.989 --> 01:43.120
is very important that you set up your iterations in such a manner that allows

01:43.120 --> 01:49.010
you to reach your milestone 1.0, which will be your first deliverable

01:49.090 --> 01:55.069
and it will be your first major release of software as early as you possibly can. During

01:55.069 --> 02:00.450
milestone 1.0, you need to try to iterate around once a month.

02:00.840 --> 02:08.409
Once a month is the standard of the industry. The industry standard. Once a month, is very important

02:08.409 --> 02:15.250
because if you iterate once a month, you will have enough time to talk to your customer to get feedback

02:15.250 --> 02:21.349
from him or her, and to basically just make all the necessary adjustments that you need.

02:21.610 --> 02:31.199
Now, sometimes something that could happen is that you have planned to reach or to

02:31.210 --> 02:35.729
basically create a certain number of user stories, and sometimes you will not have

02:35.729 --> 02:41.199
enough time to take care of all of them. What do you think you are going to do if

02:41.199 --> 02:44.849
you don't have enough time to take care of all your use or stories.

02:46.639 --> 02:51.979
If you don't have enough time to take care of all your user stories, what you need to do is go

02:51.979 --> 02:57.729
back and talk to the customer. Again, your customer will have to make decisions based

02:57.729 --> 03:06.050
on which functionality options or which features the customer will want you to include in the software

03:06.240 --> 03:12.379
So, in other words, when you don't have enough time, go back to your customer and ask your customer

03:12.379 --> 03:20.289
to re prioritize. Now, once you have agreed on achievable set of user stories for

03:20.300 --> 03:27.819
Milestone 1.0, all you have to do is set up your backlog, set up your pipeline and

03:27.819 --> 03:32.759
get developing. That is all you have to do during milestone 1.0.

03:33.050 --> 03:41.001
Well, and all good things must come to an end. And this is the end of this lesson. Thank you, I will see you soon.
