00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,949
Welcome back, in this lesson we're going to talk about understanding your customer and their requirements.

2
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:16,600
The concepts that we're going to study in this lesson are the backlog and milestone 1.0.

3
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:21,160
So the first concept we have for this lesson is the backlog.

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:28,280
What is the backlog? Well, the backlog is nothing more than a big board in your office that you're

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,219
going to set up to keep track of your development process.

6
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:39,770
You are going to need a lot of post-it notes, a lot of sticky notes with different colors, which

7
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,950
you are later going to start posting on the board to basically just keep track

8
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,770
of what's happening throughout your progress. Now, the backlog has different names.

9
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,159
Some people call it the big board on the wall. Some people call it the dashboard.

10
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,399
Some people call it the backlog. So these are different names that the backlog is going to have.

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:12,030
So now, we use this backlog to keep tabs on what work is in the pipeline, what

12
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,989
work is in progress and what work is done. It is a very good visual reminder of what's happening in

13
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:25,349
your software development process. That is the backlog. Now,

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,260
the next concept that we're going to study in this lesson is the milestone

15
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,989
1.0. We earlier talked about the milestone and what it was, but it

16
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:43,120
is very important that you set up your iterations in such a manner that allows

17
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,010
you to reach your milestone 1.0, which will be your first deliverable

18
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:55,069
and it will be your first major release of software as early as you possibly can. During

19
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:00,450
milestone 1.0, you need to try to iterate around once a month.

20
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,409
Once a month is the standard of the industry. The industry standard. Once a month, is very important

21
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:15,250
because if you iterate once a month, you will have enough time to talk to your customer to get feedback

22
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,349
from him or her, and to basically just make all the necessary adjustments that you need.

23
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:31,199
Now, sometimes something that could happen is that you have planned to reach or to

24
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,729
basically create a certain number of user stories, and sometimes you will not have

25
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:41,199
enough time to take care of all of them. What do you think you are going to do if

26
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,849
you don't have enough time to take care of all your use or stories.

27
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,979
If you don't have enough time to take care of all your user stories, what you need to do is go

28
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:57,729
back and talk to the customer. Again, your customer will have to make decisions based

29
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:06,050
on which functionality options or which features the customer will want you to include in the software

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,379
So, in other words, when you don't have enough time, go back to your customer and ask your customer

31
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:20,289
to re prioritize. Now, once you have agreed on achievable set of user stories for

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:27,819
Milestone 1.0, all you have to do is set up your backlog, set up your pipeline and

33
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,759
get developing. That is all you have to do during milestone 1.0.

34
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:41,001
Well, and all good things must come to an end. And this is the end of this lesson. Thank you, I will see you soon.
