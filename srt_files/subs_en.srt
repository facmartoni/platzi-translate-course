1
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,400
Perfect, no. Thanks to you for being here, we are really really honored to have you and, well, let's begin.

2
00:01:14,057 --> 00:01:18,257
The first question I have for you It's very simple: Why computer science?

3
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:28,400
Ah, Yes. Why computer science? I think the answer to that question is going to be different, depending on who you ask.

4
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,800
I have a very long answer to that question.

5
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:46,628
It borrows down to for me to needing to know the fundamentals and that's how I thought I could go about accomplishing that.

6
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,628
Um, so that was the short answer. Do you want the long answer?

7
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:54,942
Yeah, let's do the long answer.

8
00:01:55,485 --> 00:02:03,885
All right. So when I was... when I had the opportunity to go to college

9
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:10,514
I definitely wanted to go to college. I definitely wanted to get the education, I wanted to get that degree in the my bouts.

10
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:16,657
I didn't think I could go out and do anything unless I had a degree

11
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:23,685
And so I got a bachelor's degree, my undergrad,

12
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:29,657
And I was so fascinated with school. I love studying. Not everybody does. I do.

13
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:38,200
And there were so many degrees I could choose from. I was, uh, having a hard time, and I was tending to go towards tech

14
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:43,285
or business and or philosophy or marketing,

15
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:52,257
but I settled on business administration with, like, a sort of secondary degree in in MIS.

16
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:59,200
back then measurement of information systems was a thing. We don't talk about it anymore, but

17
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:06,257
I did a little bit of programming and did a lot of projects in school. I learned about data bases,

18
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:09,485
so I got to build some stuff through acquiring that degree.

19
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:17,400
Now, when I left, I went to work more on the business side of things that when the Internet was booming,

20
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:21,314
I went to work as an Internet marketing manager.

21
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:28,742
So I worked a couple of years doing that, and I felt that I wasn't building anything. I was analyzing a lot of spreadsheets,

22
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:34,114
I was like doing busy work, but I missed building things.

23
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:42,714
So I said, Well, I know a little bit of tech and tech was so hot, it was back in... what is it? 2008

24
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:50,142
before 2008, actually. So I said, well, I'm definitely going to be able to get a job.

25
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:56,542
So I went for it and then the market, we had the tech crash

26
00:03:57,228 --> 00:04:01,257
and nobody was hiring anymore and there were definitely hiring people

27
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:06,942
the few companies that were hiring, definitely not hiring people without a degree

28
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:16,742
or who could show that they had a lot of work experience or knowledge in programming which I didn't.

29
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:26,114
So I decided to go and get a Masters degree in computer science because I was very sure I have no choice. This is what I want to do

30
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:33,142
I wasn't necessarily wanting to get another degree. I just wanted that computer science degree.

31
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:40,942
because I didn't feel that anytime soon I would be able to walk through a door and landing a job giving the market situation.

32
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:47,828
And, um, that's how I got, that's how I ended up with a computer science degree.

33
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:55,228
Amazing. You actually fought against a very rough situation in that time.

34
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,628
Now it seems quite more easy to Start working in tech, in development, in computer science related stuff.

35
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:06,171
Actually, many big companies are hiring without a degree, right?

36
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:09,457
And now you can learn it in many, many ways.

37
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,371
What do you think about that? Like, what's your point of view on how the market has changed

38
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:19,085
And where are we right now?

39
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:27,171
The market, everything has changed. The market has changed a lot. A lot is more accessible.

40
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,114
There's so many so many courses online, so many very high quality courses online.

41
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:38,942
And even the editors The editors that I use today

42
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:45,428
I kept thinking: Wow if I had an editor like this that allow me so much inside to the code and

43
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:55,971
made it so easy to write text at the beginning, I would have, you know, getting to be an expert soon, Like...

44
00:05:56,142 --> 00:06:00,942
an expert in whatever I was doing sooner than then, however long it took

45
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:05,449
because it's so much easy to grasp what it is that you're doing.

46
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:13,200
So, yeah, everything changed with the Internet. There are so many forums, you have access to people, you can ask questions.

47
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:21,250
But I still think that there is value in getting a degree, though, even with all of the courses out there.

48
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:26,560
And I have worked with people who have degrees and with people who don't have degrees,

49
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,949
and I think there is a difference in how they approach things.

50
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,220
Yeah, I actually totally agree with that and here in

51
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,300
Platzi we're working this. This should be off the record or, I don't know, because it's a big spoiler

52
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,699
we're working on something called the School of Computer Science because we actually want

53
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:59,879
to let our students get their ability of highly abstract thinking to understand, like all

54
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,449
of the techniques and everything that they really need to do, so they can face many

55
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:10,689
challenges and they will not need a specific tutorial, a specific guide

56
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:17,089
but they will be able to think about the trouble and find a solution with the base of knowledge that

57
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:20,769
they already have. So we actually totally agree with that

58
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:27,000
and I love it how you bring that to the table. I actually have another question, and I want to know

59
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:32,490
because you're a very big open source software contributor and you've contribute to

60
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,860
amazing stuff like the go programming language. Of course, like you, you contribute to open source

61
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:44,310
software as a day job, right? And that's very interesting because, like usually everybody

62
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,730
thinks that open source software doesn't give you money like it's something you do because you want

63
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,850
to learn or because you want to do some good to the people out there and help grow any products.

64
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,420
But you're working on that. How is that process?

65
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,629
How did you do it? How did you contribute to a programming language like go? and what

66
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:10,680
can you tell us about it? Yeah, that's another question that it is going to have a million different

67
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:15,639
answers. Usually before I speak how I got into it.

68
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:23,930
Just if people wanted to get an insight, usually people do open source software.

69
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:31,269
by way of they have a need themselves they develop a little tool and they think, well, if I just

70
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:39,710
I don't do this to our extract this part of my code and put it up on a source control system, maybe

71
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:45,919
GitHub and make that available for people because the same way I needed it.

72
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:50,610
I know a lot of people going to need it, too. And that's how people get started with being a

73
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,039
maintainer. But then you being a maintainer of your own project.

74
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,009
And then other people can join and help you, and then you provoke them to maintain it, too.

75
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:05,940
And that could potentially grow, you could develop a reputation and getting to other projects, too

76
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,200
So that's one way another way is to make contributions to project.

77
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,600
And one thing that I love about open source is that you make a tiny contribution, and that is so valuable

78
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:28,179
that, you know, people think, Wow, people are always admire contributors to open source

79
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:34,679
because any contribution is valuable. I sure have made contributions.

80
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,860
And, I wouldn't necessarily write home about someone.

81
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:46,389
but you know, because if you imagine, in terms of size or complexity, yeah, they didn't make

82
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:52,019
a dent in the project necessary. But any small contribution is super valuable in

83
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,789
just the process of making that contribution, learning how to project works.

84
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:01,480
Sometimes you have to change one little code, one tiny thing

85
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,070
That is not difficult. But you do have to build a code.

86
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,259
You do have maybe to bring the test for the cold.

87
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:11,029
You have to install things around like peripherals that need to interact.

88
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,610
So you know that you didn't break anything.

89
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:21,460
and that's ah valuable lesson for you to learn, and yeah.

90
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,159
Amazing, I actually love it like we talked about how important it is to learn computer science.

91
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,330
Like the roots we talk about contributing to open source software.

92
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,759
Now, I want to talk something a little bit more spicy because, like in our community, we have a lot

93
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:43,850
of choices and a lot of people who, like cheer for a language like JavaScript it's better, no

94
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,830
the better is C, now the better is that. Do you have a favorite programming language?

95
00:10:50,440 --> 00:11:00,240
I do. Nice. Yes, I work with Go. I've been working with Go since I started letting going back

96
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:09,850
in 2015. In 2016 I got my first job, my first paying job writing code, full time, and I have not looked

97
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,889
back. I have to say I haven't looked into Rust. Um, so I don't a lot of people praise

98
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:20,879
Rust. They love it. There are a lot of similarities with Go in terms of being, ah, lingers.

99
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:27,860
That's very, a language that is very, has a good fit for for writing through the systems.

100
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:37,690
Now the reason why I like Go, is because I hate to say this because nothing computer science or programming

101
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,080
it's simple but its simple is not. I'm not saying it's easy.

102
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,639
It requires efforts for you to learn. But the syntax has.

103
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:54,210
I think 25 keywords, the API. They're very good about not changing the API, not adding

104
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,669
a lot of to the language unless they absolutely have to.

105
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:04,389
If you contrast that with Ruby, for example, just like to have a base for comparison.

106
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:13,850
When I came into Ruby, I knew C, I knew Java, I knew PHP, C# things like that.

107
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,649
So when I came into Ruby, it was completely new to me that all the aspects of programming

108
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:27,460
with a dynamic language. I thought was fascinating in absolute love

109
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:33,299
There was completely different, and also there was a whole amazing community around it.

110
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:40,600
but the whole time that I was using Ruby, I struggled with it because every time I wanted to

111
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:49,000
write a stupid function. I had to go on the Internet, look up like what was the best way to write

112
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,080
that function? like what was the best call? or like that would be like 10, 15 calls

113
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,289
that I could use, each one will have a trade off.

114
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,850
And before I submitted my code to a code review where people were going to talk about that, I'm I could

115
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:09,909
last me for into that discussion by finding what if I didn't already know, like, finally what people

116
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:15,750
think is best? It was a whole all the time I was doing that and it was pretty pathetic.

117
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,799
Rubiy is a great language, the community is to great

118
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:27,919
I just had I couldn't keep it in my head and I just felt that it was so much work,

119
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:33,190
that was busywork, basically, because there were so many options.

120
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:41,769
Now when I went, when I found out about Go first of all, the speed, because

121
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:48,340
at that time I was not just writing Ruby I was using Ruby on Rails and then I had apps that had speed

122
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:55,789
issues, like when testing and I was looking at some comparisons and Go just was

123
00:13:55,789 --> 00:14:02,320
blowing my mind in that apartment. That wasn't what holds me in, but why I stayed was because I was

124
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,870
just finding Go so minimalist and simple. I write things I I don't have to ever

125
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,700
look up on eternal live like really rare that I have to all.

126
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,809
how do I iterated through an array? Because there is only one way

127
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,289
Usually, so you know what I mean. So that's why Go is reading my favorite.

128
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,639
Like I said, I don't know Rust. I don't know absolutely all the languages.

129
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:35,549
But that's why I like Go so much. Amazing, I actually love Go the first time I use it because

130
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:43,549
I came from C programming language and I did a lot of code in C programming language, and

131
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,870
when I started to learning Go for the first time. It was like, Oh, it doesn't have classes? It only has

132
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:55,679
structs? so, like, this is amazing. This is like like C, right? and actually, many people who

133
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:01,730
didn't start with the old language, like C is, like, get a little bit confused. I actually love

134
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,019
that, and I totally agree with you about that simplicity that Go has on it, and

135
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,509
and it helps a little bit in you can have one way of doing things and

136
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:15,649
you are more confident that you are doing it the right way right?, because

137
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:18,750
when the programming languages do have more choices,

138
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,360
more options, well, the things get a little bit more complicated.

139
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:29,149
I totally agree, lovely, so what was your first programming language?

140
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:39,309
First one, Um, I'm going to say I don't remember because I went to school and I had

141
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:43,139
all this classes and I know I took like classes that required one

142
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,450
like they will give two options. So I knew it, I took C

143
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:54,399
I took Java, I took classes that where you It's those two languages, for sure.

144
00:15:54,409 --> 00:16:00,720
I think only those two actually. The first language that I gave a lot of thought to

145
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:08,230
was Java for I wanted to become an expert, play experts, to the extent possible.

146
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,500
So I started for the certification and I'm not saying certification

147
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,840
Everybody should have it, for me was like it was all about having a syllabus that I could follow in

148
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,899
check boxes like OK, I know this. I know this, I know this and don't know when those things just

149
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,549
is going to make me understand the language better.

150
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:31,679
So I got the Java entry level one the programmer certification.

151
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:39,519
So I felt very confident wit Java, so, yeah, I'll say that. I've noticed in something very important

152
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,399
and something that we actually say a lot to our students.

153
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:49,049
And it is that you don't only have one programming language and you try to do it

154
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,039
everything with that programming language, I see like you learned a lot of programming languages

155
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,210
and we actually want to know, What do you think about it?

156
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,690
Because some programmers here in LATAM or some students say, like, this is the best programming

157
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,509
language, and I want to do everything with this, like from video games to

158
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:14,029
backend services, to realtime applications, to embedded systems.

159
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:18,349
It's kind of crazy, right? Like, what do you think about that?

160
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:27,970
I think that is definitely an advantage in learning more branches now like

161
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,680
let's talk about this quick, is there many questions you within this question that are the question

162
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,490
So one question is, should you know more than one programming language? at least in my head

163
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,430
that's the one question here. Absolutely. Yes, you should make a point in learning.

164
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,539
You should know at least two, and in this very I know you're company is obviously

165
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:59,049
very multilingual. I'm here doing this interview in English and you probably going to be translating

166
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:07,069
And your audience is mostly from Latin America. If you speak two languages, you know you have an advantage

167
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:11,009
And if you're going to learn a third is going to be a lot easier, if you're going through this process

168
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,700
you know it's true. And you're in the very least you probably have heard that is true.

169
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,599
It is a very same with programming languages. You learn one and you struggle because you've never programmed

170
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:26,579
before. And then you learn the second one and it's contrasting things and all of a sudden you

171
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:29,690
start is not it is no longer about the programming language

172
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:39,009
is about computer systems, like the mechanic is the mechanics that those languages that syntax

173
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:46,509
is driving. You start to understand once you start to manipulate it with different languages, you

174
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:49,109
just like things to start coming together in your head.

175
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,130
Uh, nothing wrong witch just knowing one. I'm just saying that if you learn more, you going

176
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,950
to out automatically gain the benefit without making a lot of effort of understanding computer systems.

177
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,130
Now, should you use one language, whether you know multiple languages which are I'm not sure.

178
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,990
Should you use one language for everything? Absolutely not.

179
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,579
No, cn you like, if you're doing that as a hobby?

180
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:25,240
Sure. But is not going to be efficient. So you have to find out if you want to let you feel running

181
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:32,170
a team you have to to analyze what are the options here that would make that system that you're writing

182
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:39,960
whatever it is, be more productive like that, you have to get productivity out of your team.

183
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,720
Because if you're writing with the language, that doesn't allow you to do a bunch of things and you

184
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,460
have to like, be hacking things, you're going to shoot your product, your team productivity.

185
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,170
So language matters. I'm really loving everything you're telling us.

186
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,529
I'm really happy to have you here, thank you and I have one last question.

187
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:02,210
Here at Platzi we have a lot of students and we love them all.

188
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:10,369
But I would love for you to tell a little message to all of or possible students or potential students

189
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:16,880
that are mainly female students that don't believe that they can entered this field of computer science

190
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:24,640
and triumph here. Yeah, well, join the club because I almost feel like that every day, even

191
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,690
though I'm already have been doing this for a long time.

192
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,779
That is always something that I think Oh, it is this.

193
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:35,309
I didn't get the memo on how to do this, but I think it really helps.

194
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:42,809
I think the issue is one big issue is that when you do things in isolation, you don't know there are

195
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:49,670
other people were struggling to and I think the the issue with gender, this gender division is that

196
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,980
well, computer science and programming are top male-dominated.

197
00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:02,750
So it's very easy for guys to find guys and do the guy thing, right? in women might not want to or might not be

198
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:09,920
welcoming, because the thing is, if the all of these two group, these two groups

199
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,250
male, female, were, interacting all the time, you would see a lot of guys were naturally

200
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,529
confident and you just don't know how they know everything their turns.

201
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:26,309
I've got people like that, women too, and that's another thing that you could get exposed to women

202
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:33,069
who also are very naturally talented. But there are a lot of people who also struggle, but you don't

203
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:38,930
see because you don't interacting with them, and I have been lucky, lucky the way that I've been

204
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:46,150
I stuck to it and because I like it, and I've seen a lot of all kinds of people struggle, same

205
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,380
way I struggled. So by struggling, it's is a thing.

206
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,170
and that's something that I say to people who do want to learn computer science or

207
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:03,160
learn programming is that definitely try it out. But if you try out and you like it, stick to it

208
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,170
because it really requires persistence

209
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,390
It takes a lot of concentration.

210
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:20,029
And if you don't like it, you fight. You keep fighting and you're not going to get deep, and you

211
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:23,660
need to get deep to understand the concepts and the fundamentals.

212
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:31,710
and just talking about computer science, it really helps have following a curriculum,

213
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:39,569
and so you know, the things that you have that you can learn to give you to use.

214
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:46,970
It was not the incident. It is not the first day I was going to give it.

215
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,539
I went into totally different directions. No, but

216
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:52,960
I liked it. This is of the record, by the way for the energy.

217
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,470
Do you want to add something like, Can I do a follow up question? or

218
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,160
you're fine with that. No, no, If you want to follow up, it's fine with me.

219
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:07,410
Perfect, I loved what you say. It's very important.

220
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:14,140
It's a very important message. And actually, when you as a student, when you're starting, you see

221
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,829
these people right now who are on the top of it, and they seem to know it all and

222
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:25,859
they are your teachers, right? And they like, they are people that does everything, code in many languages

223
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:32,160
for example, Carlisia. But it's important to take notice of that like they didn't started

224
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:39,509
with all of the knowledge. So, yeah, with that, I will just ask if is there anything else you want

225
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:46,450
to say to our viewers Carlisia? Well, you make me reminds,

226
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:52,740
remember something, a lot of times when you look, look up to someone,

227
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,369
I don't even consider myself an expert. I'm an expert in the sense that I've been doing programming

228
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:04,420
for a long time. So but everything I do is new, so I feel like, Oh, my gosh, I'm struggling

229
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,160
I'm always struggling because everything is new. You know how it is.

230
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,950
But I do have I have acquired some some good feelings about things and that helps a lot.

231
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,670
Now, when you look up as someone who is an expert has been doing whatever for a long time and

232
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,519
if they speak in a way that maybe you don't understand and if you ask them a question, they might give

233
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:31,460
you an answer that makes no sense at all. And then you you might turn to yourself and think, Wow,

234
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:37,920
I answer. I asked the question that I need an answer for this person who's an expert answered

235
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:42,559
and I cannot make sense like I understand the words, but I don't know what they're saying.

236
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:47,940
It happens to me all the time, by the way, therefore, it's me, right?

237
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,650
because the expert give me an answer I should know. But this is what happens at

238
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,200
when people have been doing something for a long time.

239
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:02,309
So called experts and that is for every few they think, they think about these in a different way.

240
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,980
They talk about things in a different level and a lot of times when I ask people, people who

241
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,240
are experts, they tell me how to do things, But they're not necessarily explaining to me what I'm

242
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,869
asking, which is what even is this? don't tell me how to use it, because I can

243
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:25,900
memorize it, I can write it down, but what I want to know is what is this? because I'm not

244
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:33,920
even there yet. It's very helpful to talk with beginners or newcomers in try to learn

245
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,650
things from each other, like you agree to have the same whenever you learning something.

246
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,230
Even if you're in the field for a long time, but you're dropping into another language or a new

247
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:51,609
system, seek out beginners to to learn from and collaborate with.

248
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:56,660
Those are going to be very good experiences in my opinion.

249
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,349
Oh, that's amazing. Thank you very much.

250
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:07,309
I will only add

251
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,789
Well, Carlisia, I really loved this interview.

252
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,200
I loved having you here. I'm sure our students will want a course by you.

253
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:54,690
You will be an amazing go teacher. I'm just so happy to have you here,

254
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:00,640
really, and I wanted to say thank you. In the name of Platzi and all of our community, for sharing

255
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,420
this time with with us. I know you're a very busy person and well, I really, really thank you

256
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,410
I don't know if you wanna share your social networks where they can follow you.

257
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:15,210
You have an amazing podcast about cloud computing and

258
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,109
So maybe you can talk a little bit about that. Yeah, it was so lovely to be here

259
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:22,789
and do this. It sounds like you have a wonderful community.

260
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,730
the best way to interact with me is on Twitter I pop in there all the time.

261
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,759
I talked to people they are out in the open, and I think it's fun in the highly recommend

262
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:39,710
for talk people who are not in Twitter to hop in there and start making connections because a lot

263
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,849
happens there, people get jobs from it, is amazing.

264
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,000
So it's my first name. My first name is my handle

265
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,119
and like Ricardo said, I am a host of a podcast that talks about cloud native concepts.

266
00:27:54,599 --> 00:28:00,740
It was something I started because when I joined in this world, I was not familiar with

267
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,089
the concepts and I was asking around What is this?

268
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:10,569
What is this? And I finally figure out Hey, I want to be the change

269
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,119
I want to be the force in the world that I want. You know what I mean?

270
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:22,880
As figure. Wow. I put together a podcast to help people who are aware was a year ago.

271
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,549
and because also I didn't see that there was anything like that.

272
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:31,569
So if you want to learn about called native Concepts, hop onto the podlets.io

273
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:38,039
Yeah, thank you very much. We will, of course, put the link to your podcasts and to your twitter

274
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,650
account here on the chat so our students can follow you.

275
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:44,890
And Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you very much.

276
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,150
I'm now for our students. I want to say you something in Spanish.
