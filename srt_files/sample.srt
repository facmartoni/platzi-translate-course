Hi there. Now we're going to talk about regular and irregular verbs.

00:08.500 --> 00:14.320
We have mentioned these version previous clauses, and I'm sure that you might have an idea about them

00:14.330 --> 00:21.030
But I want to emphasize on the importance and maybe the origin off these particular verse so we can

00:21.030 --> 00:29.699
have a clear idea on why some of them have e d. Why some of them have a complete different

00:29.699 --> 00:36.570
form and, most importantly, the particular forms off the verbs that we're going to use in the next

00:36.570 --> 00:42.570
classes. That's why, in this particular point of our course, we're not going to check like a grandma

00:42.899 --> 00:47.380
tens or August. Very fancy construction terms of grammar.

00:47.390 --> 00:56.270
But just the nature off these Virts and how they can be important in the upcoming clauses because we're

00:56.270 --> 01:00.920
going to start checking the perfect tenses like present and past.

01:01.200 --> 01:07.250
So these verses are particularly important for those coming subjects.

01:07.450 --> 01:15.560
So what's a regular and what's any regular? A regular vert is just basically avert

01:15.569 --> 01:20.930
that follows a pattern consistently. That's why we call them regular, because they

01:20.930 --> 01:29.150
all followed the same rule. So when we talk about past or past participle, we use e

01:29.150 --> 01:33.599
D right, So I watch would be the present for him.

01:34.079 --> 01:44.140
I watched would be the past form and I watched is the past participle form So you notice the

01:44.140 --> 01:49.000
past on the partisan poll are the same. They don't change.

01:49.260 --> 01:55.430
That's why dessert it's regular, right? It follows the same pattern.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.310
It doesn't change from the past to the past participle.

01:59.519 --> 02:08.729
And just like this burg, there are many others in English watch except no I accept present

02:09.150 --> 02:16.979
I accept it past and I have. Except that would be the past participle again.

02:17.319 --> 02:21.250
The construction is very simple. I just have to include e d.

02:21.930 --> 02:26.259
And it follows the same structure for the past participle.

02:26.800 --> 02:36.409
But we also have you ready universe and irregular means that it doesn't follow a pattern.

02:36.569 --> 02:40.979
It has some irregularities now is not consistent.

02:41.599 --> 02:46.580
And just like in Spanish, in English there are many regular words.

02:46.719 --> 02:51.840
So do the do the homework can see you have in your native language.

02:51.849 --> 02:57.569
There are some irregularities, but in this case we're going to see that possibility in English.

02:57.939 --> 03:06.689
So irregular verbs are verbs for which the rule off the E d cannot be applied Example

03:07.009 --> 03:14.419
present. See past. So whips. We don't have the D because this work is irregular and

03:14.419 --> 03:23.500
plus participle seem three completely different words that don't follow a specific potter.

03:23.870 --> 03:28.800
So one of the most common questions is why, Why that happens?

03:29.210 --> 03:36.530
Well, there is like a historical explanation for things, and that's why they have here the

03:36.530 --> 03:39.810
regular version. English. Most of them are native.

03:40.500 --> 03:46.430
What's the meaning of that? That means that, you know, languages have ah ah on

03:46.430 --> 03:55.030
evolving process, you know, just like human beings and other phenomenons in the nature languages

03:55.030 --> 04:02.810
follow a similar pattern, and they evolved. So that means that a long time ago when

04:02.810 --> 04:08.400
English was part off Nords and old English, you know, like we're talking about.

04:08.400 --> 04:17.199
Like 1000 years ago, these birds existed there, and these birds hot some dynamics that

04:17.199 --> 04:24.930
make them irregular. Example See, so seen break broke, broken.

04:25.389 --> 04:36.379
This particular vert comes from a North Ruth. A similar word was used in Nordic

04:36.389 --> 04:39.839
languages, and then it got combined with English.

04:39.839 --> 04:44.660
And that's why we have the result on the work that we have today.

04:44.850 --> 04:51.540
So all the irregular verbs come from that native prose is off evolution.

04:51.769 --> 04:58.069
So That's why, in the examples that I have here, I have shown how these verse have

04:58.069 --> 05:04.490
their own dynamics. They make their changes very separately, very differently from the way that the

05:04.490 --> 05:08.300
regular verbs do their changes. You know they don't involve the E.

05:08.300 --> 05:16.500
D in any part of the produce, but we're going to focus for next closets on the use of the past participle

05:16.500 --> 05:22.350
for that is broken, given and gotten from these particular examples because this is the one.

05:22.360 --> 05:26.300
This is the form that we have to use for these perfect constructions.

05:26.310 --> 05:33.660
I have worked. You have broken right so again, regular verse.

05:33.730 --> 05:38.490
They come from a natural development process off language.

05:38.639 --> 05:48.670
And, um, the regular ones are verbs that were acquired are verse the were borrowed from

05:48.779 --> 05:58.170
or the languages or that basically just appeared later in the lexicon, off the language for like coal

05:58.389 --> 06:04.930
which is borrowed from a different word. In another language, north birds like repair

06:04.939 --> 06:10.000
that comes from Latin and birds like, except that comes also from Latin.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.709
Remember that English is a language that has most of its lexicon comes from Latin and

06:16.709 --> 06:25.680
French. So mother from North and another part from the native vocabulary that was used when

06:25.680 --> 06:31.319
the language appeared. So just to recap, we just practise.

06:31.319 --> 06:37.379
Or we just checked why regular verbs on irregular verbs are the way they are.

06:38.089 --> 06:42.310
Why some of these verbs work in a different way than the others.

06:42.980 --> 06:51.019
And most importantly, how we're going to use these verbs for this future for the perfect tenses like

06:51.339 --> 07:00.180
present, perfect and past perfect. Also, we're going to use them for motels, but that's another

07:00.180 --> 07:02.709
topic that we're going to check in other classes.

07:02.839 --> 07:09.519
So keeping this in mind, we're going to use these information for the next class, which is present

07:09.519 --> 07:13.889
perfect, right? So we're going to put in to use the information that we've checked in.

07:13.899 --> 07:19.420
He's one, and we're going to start transmitting and communicating ideas with this in
