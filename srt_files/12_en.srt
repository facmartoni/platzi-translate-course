1
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:09,419
Hey there. Now we're going to check Present. Perfect continues.

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,300
Okay, so we have far different structures going on year.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,379
So we're going to take some information from previous clauses.

4
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:24,179
We're going to check something new and most importantly, when we have to use present

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,899
Perfect continues. So what's present? Perfect. Continue.

6
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,329
So, as you know, from the previous close present, perfect.

7
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:38,140
We use it to talk about experiences and we don't emphasize if the action is finished or if it was completed

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:47,219
or homing tanks. It happened. Not really. But when we use the continuity, there's when we add the

9
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,350
continues aspect of it, we do emphasize duration.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,570
So we emphasize that inaction started in the past and continues all the way up to

11
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,620
the present. So in terms off structure, since it is present perfect, we have to use the

12
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,849
axillary for the perfect sentences, which is half or house, depending on the subject.

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,250
We also have to use the verb in the past partisan bull, you know, like the third

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:27,859
column of the verbs that we have talked about. But since we're including the continues aspect

15
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:34,959
to it, we're going toe talk about continuity are lasting action we have to use the

16
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:41,750
adage. Remember the association? Every time that we talk about Perfect, we have house

17
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,750
on past participle, and every time that we talk about continues, it involves some

18
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:58,129
form of the verb to be on D i n g. So all of these concepts come together to express in

19
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:01,629
action that started in the past and continues all the way to the present.

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:10,849
So what's it? What that's it look like? Well, I have Bean practicing my reading skills for the last

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:19,840
two weeks. You see, easy to understand, I am asking, or I am transmitting on

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,580
information that deals with an action that started in the past and continued for

23
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,979
two weeks in this particular example. So what's the construction?

24
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:39,360
Let's see how it goes. So because you're gonna see we have again the axillary, which is half for

25
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:48,379
all the perfect fences. And since we're talking about continues, we also have to include the vert

26
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:53,270
Toby on and I in Gene divert and where's ever to be here?

27
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:01,349
It's conjugated in the past parties. Why? Because it's followed, um, by half

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,360
That's it. You know, after half we have the vertebrae in passport is people, just as

29
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,250
it would be if it were a normal present. Perfect structure.

30
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:25,210
So the continuity aspect is being transmitted by half and they were to be in passports and

31
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:33,639
then I n g So if you notice this structure is even even easier than the previous ones because

32
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,139
the structure is always going to be the same half inverted V.

33
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:44,129
That means half being. Or if we're talking about she like in the negative example we have here House

34
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:52,280
Yes, have Bean has bean have bean has been This is the one that we're always going to be using and

35
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,400
then the only modification, the only change that we're going to express is the vert.

36
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,280
But this verb is always going to be 90 so very, very simple.

37
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,900
So let's check more Ah, examples in which we could use this.

38
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:16,160
For example. You want to talk about an action that has bean happening all of these days all

39
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:26,250
the way up to the present. For example, I have bean taking English clauses for

40
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:35,189
two months now, So the action started two months ago and it continued all the way nonstop till

41
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:42,709
the present. So I emphasized that continuities aspect of it by using the i n g for

42
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:49,370
this construction. So the present perfect part makes it in the past on the continues foreign makes

43
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,870
it to talk about a continues action. So I have bean practicing.

44
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,009
I have me reading. I have been sleeping a lot Graham on vacation.

45
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,930
So that actually started. The bus continues in the present.

46
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:09,959
So again, the construction four questions. It's going to be quite similar depending

47
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,439
on the answer that you're looking for. If what we're looking for is that yes or no answer, we use

48
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,930
Ah, the construction first with the exterior. So have you been playing since yesterday?

49
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,449
Yes, I have, like every single day. Yes, I have, or no, I haven't.

50
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:36,879
But if what we're looking for is a complete I'm certain we use where I was interrogated Pregnant?

51
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,139
Where have you been hiding all this time? No, I'm sorry.

52
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:49,060
I've bean working a lot lately. I'm being very BC I have been taking care of a lot of problems

53
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:55,449
that I've had Do emphasize the D action starting the past continues in the present and

54
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:02,439
for the negative as well. We used the negative particle not and is going to be located again.

55
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:11,250
Between the axillary on and been bean is always going to be used in present.

56
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:16,550
Perfect continues because for two continues, I repeat, we have to use the verb to be.

57
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:24,449
And since this virtue ease after the axillary, we have to use being which is the past participle for

58
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:28,100
So we look at the example from the negative part we have.

59
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:35,509
She has not bean feeling well lately. So she started feeling poorly in the past and

60
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:43,550
that action continues in the present. She's still feeling, but she's not feeling well.

61
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:50,360
Yes, I have been sleeping as much as I need. I haven't been sleeping as much as I need.

62
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:59,040
A couple of days ago, I started to sleep less than a shoot and that action still

63
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,740
happening? Maybe this person is BZ o. It has a lot of work show Just to recap, we go when

64
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:14,040
we see the use of the present perfect combined with a continues form so present perfect.

65
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,910
We have dictionary half on the past participle and with the continues, we have the

66
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:26,529
verb to be a 90. We combined this together and we have present perfect continues A

67
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:34,029
structure that includes the national started in the past and continues all the way to the present.

68
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,500
And we emphasize the time. Right? So I have been practicing guitar.

69
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:48,480
No, several days is weak by now. I have been reading many books lately because

70
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,540
I have a lot of free time. Action started. The past continues in the press.

71
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,370
So these concludes the present perfect constructions.

72
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:05,019
Both the simple one on the continues one because now we're going to jump for the

73
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:09,279
perfect part. But of the past. So in the next cause, we're going to check past

74
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,410
perfect and what it works for. How do we use it?
