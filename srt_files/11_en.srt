1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:11,380
welcome back. So remember the topic that we discussed in previous clauses, um, regular irregular

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:18,129
birds and how these different verbs interact with different tenses this past or future Serra

3
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:26,149
tear up. But for these particular cause, we're going to see the use off the past participle, right

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,980
Which is, if you look at a vert on a list, you will always find there are like three

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:38,049
columns. First column expresses the present second column spreads the past and the third, the past

6
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:44,390
participle. And that's the one that we're going to use for these construction present

7
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,299
Perfect. Now what is that present perfect? Well, prison perfect.

8
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:56,100
He's on a structure that we use to emphasize in action that started in the past and

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,539
that we don't mention if the action is finished. We don't mention it.

10
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,700
The action lasted. We don't even know if the action continues in the present.

11
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,870
Most likely it does. But that's the beauty of present perfect it hasn't expressed.

12
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,200
We give detailed information about the action, right?

13
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:21,019
So first they'll let the name fool you because it's not present per se.

14
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:28,629
Is Buster what we're talking about, you know, and in action that is not complete

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,840
or at least we don't emphasize that is complete. Now, what are the most common uses

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,569
of these structure? Well, we can use them to talk about experiences, or we can use them to talk about

17
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:46,409
changes. Or we can use them about for situations that started in the past.

18
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:55,280
And maybe they continue in present. Right? So we'll see how these structure is used to talk about

19
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,909
Maybe you can use it to talk about different experiences that you've had in your life.

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,950
No. Have you ever visited United States? Yes, of course I have.

21
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,050
Perfect on experience. Generally emphasize or you don't mention when these action

22
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:20,590
happened. But you just mentioned the event. Just I have when I don't know is not important.

23
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,539
Did it take a lot of time to complete the action?

24
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,199
We don't know, because present perfect is not very specific.

25
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:35,240
If you want to emphasize a specific action in the past that was completed, then we use simple past

26
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,460
I visited the United States last year and I was there for two weeks.

27
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,439
Right? But this is not the case because we're talking about experiences.

28
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,789
I have visited many countries. Okay, which ones?

29
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:55,629
I don't know. Not important. How long ago did you did you go to This place is again

30
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,080
It's not important just mentioning the situation or the action in the past.

31
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,490
So let's check the structure a little bit more in death.

32
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:14,629
So as you can see here in the different questions and negatives were using anoxia

33
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:22,039
And these actuary is half. So you see how the pattern repeats itself over and over as

34
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,550
we go through the different tenses of English house.

35
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,340
They were talking about the present we used Do a search, Hillary.

36
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,430
We talk about Paz. We use DEET for these particular structure.

37
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:39,750
We use half and half easier chillier, right? And it follows the same dynamics.

38
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:47,090
If we're talking about you we day I I use half. But we're talking about he or she you

39
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:54,439
use house. So it follows a similar behaviour of the one off Duke and us.

40
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:02,569
Now you will see that after half the verb Easy nam different foreign.

41
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,400
This is the past participles. We would check the first example in the question Have

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:17,050
you wien to the new restaurant yet? I'm using the form in past participle off the vert movie

43
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:25,100
And the purpose of this is to ask you if these experience has happened in your life, right?

44
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:32,000
The answer can be yes or no. We don't mention when the action happened with a mention of the action

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,560
is finished. We don't mention anything off that nature.

46
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm just interested in seeing the action happened or not.

47
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,709
Yes, so for that could be the yes or no question.

48
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,350
Have you been to the new restaurant yet? Josie, have?

49
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,860
No, I haven't. Yes. And if I want to ask more complex question.

50
00:04:53,189 --> 00:05:02,899
What have you done lately? Okay. In this case, I'm looking for a more complex answer

51
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:14,579
So okay, lately I have practiced Ah, soccer. I have watched many Siris on the Internet.

52
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,579
I have read many books, experiences, actions that have happened.

53
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,149
But if you analyze each of these sentences, I have watched many Siri's online.

54
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:36,540
When I don't know, this is not important. I have read different books lately when

55
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,019
Specifically yesterday. Two weeks ago. Again. That is not important when we use present

56
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:50,930
Perfect. Because the focus off these construction is just to know if financial it happened or

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,180
not in the past. Yes, and we don't emphasize if it's finished or not.

58
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,990
And in case you want to use the negative construction again, we use the good old negative

59
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:11,100
particle. Not, and it's going to be located between the axillary on the verb in past participle,

60
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,550
just like the first example, she has not finished the test.

61
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:22,509
She has houses the axillary for present perfect congregated for she.

62
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:30,300
That's why we have Haas than Negative Particle and then finished in this case, finish is

63
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,250
a regular burger. So finished, finished finished.

64
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,670
That's the one that we use. She has not finished the test in this case.

65
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,629
The action is not complete, and we don't emphasize any time in particular because that's

66
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:49,149
not important, you know, is not relevant for these particular example.

67
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,310
The other one. I haven't been here for a long time again.

68
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,000
This particular we express like change or lack of change because the action maybe

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,579
happened at some point in the past. On it hasn't evolved or it hasn't changed up

70
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:15,980
onto this moment. But again, I don't emphasize when was the last time that I was here or

71
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:23,629
Holland direction to again? Remember, present Perfect doesn't emphasize duration

72
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:30,050
doesn't emphasize if the action is complete. No, for that we use the past simple here

73
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,220
We just mentioned if in action happened, took place in the past.

74
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,250
That's why it's so perfect when we talk about experienced.

75
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:46,730
I have tried typical food from different places. I have visited many interesting

76
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:55,310
cities in my country. I have watched these movies several times when we don't mention it and

77
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:02,759
thats why Present Perfect is so commonly used for these particular constructions show

78
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,819
experiences and changes, probably situations that's still happening.

79
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:12,199
The present. No, I have worked here for many months.

80
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,189
I should start in the past. You don't emphasize the specific moment, but maybe

81
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,600
the actually is not finished, so it's still happening in the present.

82
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:28,740
So just to recap use of present perfect, they use off the absolutely half with

83
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:36,100
the past participle off the verbs. Keep in mind that this plus past participle can be regular or irregular

84
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:42,669
going back to the previous class but past participle nonetheless.

85
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,519
So for the next class we're going to see a similar construction.

86
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:55,039
But in the next construction, we emphasize duration that's called present, Perfect continues, but
