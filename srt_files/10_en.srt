00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,490
Hi there. Now we're going to talk about regular and irregular verbs.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,320
We have mentioned these version previous clauses, and I'm sure that you might have an idea about them

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:21,030
But I want to emphasize on the importance and maybe the origin off these particular verse so we can

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:29,699
have a clear idea on why some of them have e d. Why some of them have a complete different

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,570
form and, most importantly, the particular forms off the verbs that we're going to use in the next

6
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,570
classes. That's why, in this particular point of our course, we're not going to check like a grandma

7
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,380
tens or August. Very fancy construction terms of grammar.

8
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:56,270
But just the nature off these Virts and how they can be important in the upcoming clauses because we're

9
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,920
going to start checking the perfect tenses like present and past.

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,250
So these verses are particularly important for those coming subjects.

11
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:15,560
So what's a regular and what's any regular? A regular vert is just basically avert

12
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,930
that follows a pattern consistently. That's why we call them regular, because they

13
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:29,150
all followed the same rule. So when we talk about past or past participle, we use e

14
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,599
D right, So I watch would be the present for him.

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:44,140
I watched would be the past form and I watched is the past participle form So you notice the

16
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,000
past on the partisan poll are the same. They don't change.

17
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:55,430
That's why dessert it's regular, right? It follows the same pattern.

18
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,310
It doesn't change from the past to the past participle.

19
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:08,729
And just like this burg, there are many others in English watch except no I accept present

20
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:16,979
I accept it past and I have. Except that would be the past participle again.

21
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,250
The construction is very simple. I just have to include e d.

22
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,259
And it follows the same structure for the past participle.

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:36,409
But we also have you ready universe and irregular means that it doesn't follow a pattern.

24
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,979
It has some irregularities now is not consistent.

25
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,580
And just like in Spanish, in English there are many regular words.

26
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,840
So do the do the homework can see you have in your native language.

27
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:57,569
There are some irregularities, but in this case we're going to see that possibility in English.

28
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:06,689
So irregular verbs are verbs for which the rule off the E d cannot be applied Example

29
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:14,419
present. See past. So whips. We don't have the D because this work is irregular and

30
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:23,500
plus participle seem three completely different words that don't follow a specific potter.

31
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,800
So one of the most common questions is why, Why that happens?

32
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:36,530
Well, there is like a historical explanation for things, and that's why they have here the

33
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,810
regular version. English. Most of them are native.

34
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,430
What's the meaning of that? That means that, you know, languages have ah ah on

35
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:55,030
evolving process, you know, just like human beings and other phenomenons in the nature languages

36
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:02,810
follow a similar pattern, and they evolved. So that means that a long time ago when

37
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,400
English was part off Nords and old English, you know, like we're talking about.

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:17,199
Like 1000 years ago, these birds existed there, and these birds hot some dynamics that

39
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:24,930
make them irregular. Example See, so seen break broke, broken.

40
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:36,379
This particular vert comes from a North Ruth. A similar word was used in Nordic

41
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,839
languages, and then it got combined with English.

42
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,660
And that's why we have the result on the work that we have today.

43
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:51,540
So all the irregular verbs come from that native prose is off evolution.

44
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:58,069
So That's why, in the examples that I have here, I have shown how these verse have

45
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:04,490
their own dynamics. They make their changes very separately, very differently from the way that the

46
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,300
regular verbs do their changes. You know they don't involve the E.

47
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:16,500
D in any part of the produce, but we're going to focus for next closets on the use of the past participle

48
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,350
for that is broken, given and gotten from these particular examples because this is the one.

49
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,300
This is the form that we have to use for these perfect constructions.

50
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:33,660
I have worked. You have broken right so again, regular verse.

51
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,490
They come from a natural development process off language.

52
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:48,670
And, um, the regular ones are verbs that were acquired are verse the were borrowed from

53
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:58,170
or the languages or that basically just appeared later in the lexicon, off the language for like coal

54
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:04,930
which is borrowed from a different word. In another language, north birds like repair

55
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:10,000
that comes from Latin and birds like, except that comes also from Latin.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,709
Remember that English is a language that has most of its lexicon comes from Latin and

57
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:25,680
French. So mother from North and another part from the native vocabulary that was used when

58
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,319
the language appeared. So just to recap, we just practise.

59
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:37,379
Or we just checked why regular verbs on irregular verbs are the way they are.

60
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:42,310
Why some of these verbs work in a different way than the others.

61
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:51,019
And most importantly, how we're going to use these verbs for this future for the perfect tenses like

62
00:06:51,339 --> 00:07:00,180
present, perfect and past perfect. Also, we're going to use them for motels, but that's another

63
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,709
topic that we're going to check in other classes.

64
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:09,519
So keeping this in mind, we're going to use these information for the next class, which is present

65
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,889
perfect, right? So we're going to put in to use the information that we've checked in.

66
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:19,420
He's one, and we're going to start transmitting and communicating ideas with this in
